Both directly and indirectly one must act only for the welfare of sentient beings.One should bend everything to their wel
fare and to their Enlightenment.

One should never abandon, even for the sake of one’s life,a good friend who holds to the law of the Bodhisattva and who i
s skilled in the ways of the Mahāyāna.

As indicated by the Śrīsaṃbhavavimokṣa, one ought to practice whatever is taught by the masters.From the recitation of sū
tras, both this one and others, that which has been spoken by the Buddha is to be known.

The rules are seen in the sūtras. Because of this, one should recite the sūtras.And in the Ākāśagarbhasūtra one should ex
amine the root sins.

The Śikṣāsamuccaya certainly is to be looked at again and again,because good conduct is explained there in detail.

Or else, in the meantime, one should consult the Sūtrasammucaya, as a compendium;and [its] companion composed by the nobl
e Nāgārjuna [should be studied] zealously.

After you have learned in the discipline wherein you are prohibited and wherein you are commanded,you ought to act for th
e purpose of protecting the mind in all situations.

This, then, in brief, is the mark of total awareness:the continual examination of the state of one’s body and of one’s mi
nd.

Thus I read with the body, but what good is speaking and reading?What good is a mere medical treatise to the sick?
